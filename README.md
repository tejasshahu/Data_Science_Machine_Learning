This repository is all about Data Science, Machine Learning course from scratch which I have done.

I have covered and implemented basic understanding and practical implementation of all libraries and tools which is used in this project.

Covered topics and Explanation of Files:

.ipynb = jupyter notebook files ready to run

1) **Jupyter_Notebook:**
It was just understanding about jupyter notebook which I undertstood and tried.

2) **Demo Data (directory):**
It has some files which are used in projects or has been generated from projects.

3) **learn_pandas:**
Some of the basic methods go through and its implementation which will be helpful in Machine learning/Data Science.

3) **learn_numpy:**
Some of the basic methods go through and its implementation which will be helpful in Machine learning/Data Science.

4) **example_numpy_pandas(sales) - small assignment:**
An example to test your numpy and pandas understanding together.

5) **learn_matplotlib:**
Some of the basic methods go through and its implementation which will be helpful in Machine learning/Data Science.

6) **learn_scikit-learn:**
This file has lots of stuff all about how can we use SciKit Learn Library for Machine Learning.
Main Things which has been covered:

	0. An end-to-end scikit learn workflow.
	1. Getting the data ready.
	2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problem.
	3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make prediction on our data. 
	4. Evaluating a model.
	5. Improve a model.
	6. Save and load a trained model
	7. putting it all together!!!

**What is Structured data vs Unstructured data?**

	Structured Data: The traditional row and column structure or similar tabular style file (such as in an Excel spreadsheet or pandas DataFrame).
	Unstructured Data: It includes the data which is in form of images, audio and natural language.

7) **Sample_Projects:** End-to-end project has been created for `Structured` and `Unstructured` problems:
	
	1. Heart Disease problem prediction (Classification problem) that patient will have heart disease or not based on trained dataset.
	2. Dog's breed detection by Deeplearning, Transfer Learning (Used data and resource's links are available in jupyter notebook file .ipynb which is ready to run in your Colab or environment).
